<Update label="February 2025">
  ## New Configuration Schema `docs.json`

We've introduced a new `docs.json` schema as a replacement for `mint.json`, to support better multi-level versioning, easier visual comprehension, and more consistent terminology. For more information on what's changed, [check out our blog](https://mintlify.com/blog/refactoring-mint-json-into-docs-json).

Upgrade from `mint.json` to `docs.json` with the following steps:

1. Make sure your CLI is the latest version

```
npm i mintlify@latest -g
```

1. In your docs repository, run

```
mintlify upgrade
```

1. Delete your old mint.json file and push your changes

## CI Checks

Automatically lint your docs to find broken links, discover spelling and grammar issues, or enforce writing styles with your own Vale config. Learn more in our [docs](settings/ci).

## .md support for LLMs

All documentation pages are now automatically available as plain Markdown files—just append `.md` to the URL. This makes it easier for LLMs to ingest individual pages from your documentation.

## More Themes

New [pre-built themes](/themes) to modify the look & feel of your docs. Configure via your [docs.json file](/settings/global).

Now available:

- Maple
- Palm
- Willow

## Other improvements

- [Guide to Technical Writing:](https://mintlify.com/guides/introduction)Best practices for writing technical documentation, including audience research, content types, and writing tips.
- [Dropdown component](/navigation/divisions#dropdowns): Organize navigation with a dropdown, in addition to tabs and anchors.
- [AI syntax fixer](https://x.com/ricardonunez_io/status/1892334887644123192): The web editor will catch if there’s a parsing error and use AI to suggest fixes.
