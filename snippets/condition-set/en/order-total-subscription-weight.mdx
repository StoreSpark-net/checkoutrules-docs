### Order total subscription weight

This condition checks the **total weight of subscription items** in the order against specific criteria, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **is greater than or equals** (Matches when the total subscription weight is greater than or equal to the entered weight)
- **is less than or equals** (Matches when the total subscription weight is less than or equal to the entered weight)

To set these conditions, enter the weight in the field, select the weight unit (**lb**, **oz**, **kg**, or **g**) from the dropdown, and choose the appropriate comparison.

> For example, `is greater than or equals 5 kg` â†’ Matches orders where the total weight of subscription items is 5 kilograms or more.
