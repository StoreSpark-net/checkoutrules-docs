### Product tags

This condition checks the **Product Tags** against specific criteria. It will become true if **any** product in the cart has the entered Product Tag value, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Has any of these values** (Matches if the Product Tags have at least one of the entered values)
- **Does not have any of these values** (Matches if the Product Tags have none of the entered values)
- **Has any other value besides these values** (Matches if the Product Tags have a value that is not among the entered values)
- **Does not have any other value besides these values** (Matches if the Product Tags have only the entered values and no others)
- **Has number of values greater than or equals** (Matches if the **count** of Product Tags is greater than or equal to the entered number)
- **Has number of values less than or equals** (Matches if the **count** of Product Tags is less than or equal to the entered number)

<Warning>
  You can only use this condition with the same values throughout the rule. If
  you want to use different values in different rule blocks, you should switch
  to condition set 3, 5, or 6 which allow more flexibility.
</Warning>

For **Has any of these values**, **Does not have any of these values**, **Has any other value besides these values**, and **Does not have any other value besides these values**, enter one or more Product Tag values into the field. Separate multiple values with commas.

> For example, `Does not have any of these values: summer, clearance` → Matches if the Product Tag does not include “summer” or “clearance”.

For **Has number of values greater than or equals** and **Has number of values less than or equals**, enter a single numeric value in the field to match the Product Tags count.

> For example, `Has number of values less than or equals 4` → Matches if there are four or fewer Product Tags.
