### Country

Used to compare the Country (The Country field on the checkout page in shipping address) values with one or more specific countries, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Has any of these values** (Matches if the country field contains at least one of the selected countries)
- **Does not have any of these values** (Matches if the country field does not contain any of the selected countries)
- **Has any other value besides these values** (Matches if the country field contains countries other than the selected ones)
- **Does not have any other value besides these values** (Matches if the country field contains only the selected countries and no others)

For any of the above options, search and select one or more countries from the list. You can also use the **Paste**, **Copy all**, or **Clear all** options for quick selection.

> For example, `Does not have any other value besides these values: Portugal, Poland` → Matches if the field contains only “Portugal” or “Poland” and no other countries.
