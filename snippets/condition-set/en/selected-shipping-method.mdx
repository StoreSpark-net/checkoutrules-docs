### Selected shipping method

This condition checks the customer’s **selected shipping method** against specific criteria, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **contains** (The selected shipping method includes the entered value)
- **does not contain** (The selected shipping method does not include the entered value)

- **is** (The selected shipping method exactly matches the entered value)
- **is not** (The selected shipping method does not exactly match the entered value)

To set these conditions, enter the value in the field and choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.

> For example, `contains Express` → Matches any selected shipping method that includes “Express”.
