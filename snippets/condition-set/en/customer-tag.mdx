### Customer tag

This condition checks the **customer’s tag** against specific criteria, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **has value of** (Matches when the customer’s tags include the entered value)
- **does not have value of** (Matches when the customer’s tags do not include the entered value)

To set these conditions, enter the tag value in the field and choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.

> For example, `has value of VIP` → Matches customers who have the **VIP** tag.
