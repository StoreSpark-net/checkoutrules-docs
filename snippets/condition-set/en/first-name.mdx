Used to compare the customer’s first name with one or more specific values, counts, or states, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Contains** (Matches if the first name contains the specified value or partial value)
- **Does not contain** (Matches if the first name does not contain the specified value or partial value)
- **Is empty** (Matches if no first name is entered)
- **Is not empty** (Matches if any value is entered in the first name field)
- **Is** (Matches if the first name exactly matches the specified value)
- **Is not** (Matches if the first name is not exactly the specified value)
- **Has no of characters greater than or equals** (Matches if the total character count in the first name is greater than or equal to the specified number)
- **Has no of characters less than or equals** (Matches if the total character count in the first name is less than or equal to the specified number)
- **Has only** (Matches if the first name contains only the allowed character type from the dropdown)
- **Does not have only** (Matches if the first name contains characters other than the allowed character type from the dropdown)

For **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is**, and **Is not**, enter the value to match.
