### Customer total number of previous orders

This condition checks the **total number of previous orders** placed by the customer against specific criteria, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **is greater than or equals** (Matches when the customer’s total number of previous orders is greater than or equal to the entered number)
- **is less than or equals** (Matches when the customer’s total number of previous orders is less than or equal to the entered number)

To set these conditions, enter the number of orders in the field and choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.

> For example, `is greater than or equals 3` → Matches customers who have placed 3 or more previous orders.
