### SKU

This condition checks the **SKU** of the products in the cart against specific criteria. It will become true if **any** product in the cart has the entered SKU value, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Has any of these values** (Matches if the SKU has at least one of the entered values)
- **Does not have any of these values** (Matches if the SKU has none of the entered values)
- **Has any other value besides these values** (Matches if the SKU has a value that is not among the entered values)
- **Does not have any other value besides these values** (Matches if the SKU has only the entered values and no others)
- **Has number of values greater than or equals** (Matches if the **count** of SKUs is greater than or equal to the entered number)
- **Has number of values less than or equals** (Matches if the **count** of SKUs is less than or equal to the entered number)

For **Has any of these values**, **Does not have any of these values**, **Has any other value besides these values**, and **Does not have any other value besides these values**, enter one or more SKU values into the field. Separate multiple values with commas.

<Note>
  Use * wildcard to match multiple SKU values. For example, SKU* will match
  SKU12, sku-new-1 etc.
</Note>
> For example, `Has any of these values: SKU1, SKU2` → Matches if the SKU is either
“SKU1” or “SKU2”.{" "}
