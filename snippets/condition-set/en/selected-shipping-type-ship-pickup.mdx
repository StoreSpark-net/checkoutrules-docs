It will become true if the selected shipping type is the same as the entered value, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **is** (Matches if the Delivery selection is exactly as the entered value)
- **is not** (Matches if the Delivery selection is different from the entered value)

For any of the above options, choose one shipping type from the list: **Pickup**, **Local delivery**, **Shipping**, **Pickup point**, **Retail**, or **None**.

> **Example:** `is not: Pickup` → Matches if the selected shipping type is anything other than “Pickup”, i-e it is "Ship".
