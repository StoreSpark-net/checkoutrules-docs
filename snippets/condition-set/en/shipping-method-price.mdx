### Shipping method price

This condition checks the **shipping method’s price** based on the selected shipping name criteria and price comparison rule. You can configure it using the following options:

**Shipping name criteria:**

- **shipping name contains** (Matches when the shipping method name includes the entered text)
- **shipping name is** (Matches when the shipping method name exactly matches the entered text)
- **any shipping method** (Matches regardless of the shipping method name)

**Price comparison options:**

- **price is greater than or equals** (Matches when the shipping method price is greater than or equal to the entered amount)
- **price is less than or equals** (Matches when the shipping method price is less than or equal to the entered amount)

> For example, `shipping name contains Express` + `price is greater than or equals 200` → Matches orders with a shipping method name containing “Express” and a shipping price of 200 or more.
