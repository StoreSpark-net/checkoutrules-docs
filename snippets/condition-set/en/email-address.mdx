### Email address

This condition checks the customer’s **email address** against specific criteria, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **contains** (The email address includes the entered value)
- **does not contain** (The email address does not include the entered value)
- **is empty** (No email address is provided)
- **is not empty** (An email address is provided)
- **is** (The email address exactly matches the entered value)
- **is not** (The email address does not exactly match the entered value)

For **contains**, **does not contain**, **is**, and **is not**, type a value in the text box to compare against the customer’s email address.

> For example, `contains @gmail.com` → Matches any email address ending with “@gmail.com”.
