- **is greater than or equals** (Matches when the order’s total amount is greater than or equal to the entered amount)
- **is less than or equals** (Matches when the order’s total amount is less than or equal to the entered amount)

To set these conditions, enter the amount in the field and choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.
