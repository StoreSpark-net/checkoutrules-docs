### P.O. box address

The selected condition is based on whether the customer's address includes a P.O. Box. This condition can be used to trigger specific actions, such as restricting certain shipping methods or applying special handling rules for orders going to P.O. Box addresses.

<Note>
  When you use the 'P.O. box address' condition in the rule, then all kind of
  entries in the shipping address like P.O. box or P O box or P.o b o x etc are
  detected by the app automatically. If you want to also detect a custom word or
  phrase, you can do that by using the 'Address line' condition within which you
  can specify the word or phrase you want to detect.
</Note>

<Info>
  If you want to detect PO Box words or phrase in other languages, you can do
  that by using the 'Address (line1 + line2)' condition within which you can
  specify the words or phrase you want to detect. For example, 'Packstation' in
  German. You can add mulitple of these conditions for each word using the OR
  operator in between them.
