### Market

Used to compare the actual market value on the checkout page, with one or more specific given markets (from Shopify markets setup in your store), based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Has any of these values** (Matches if the market contains at least one of the given markets in the list)
- **Does not have any of these values** (Matches if the market does not contain any of the given markets in the list)
- **Has any other value besides these values** (Matches if the market contains markets other than the given markets in the list)
- **Does not have any other value besides these values** (Matches if the market contains only the given markets in the list and no others)

For any of the above options, search and select one or more markets from the list. You can also use the **Paste**, **Copy all**, or **Clear all** options for quick selection.

> For example, `Does not have any other value besides these values: Pakistan` → Matches if the field contains only “Pakistan” and no other markets.
