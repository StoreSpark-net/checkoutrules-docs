### Order total quantity

This condition checks the **total quantity of items in an order** against specific criteria, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **is greater than or equals** (Matches when the total quantity of items is greater than or equal to the entered number)
- **is less than or equals** (Matches when the total quantity of items is less than or equal to the entered number)
- **is multiple of** (Matches when the total quantity is an exact multiple of the entered number)
- **is not multiple of** (Matches when the total quantity is not a multiple of the entered number)

To set these conditions, enter a quantity in the field and choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.

<Note>
  The quantity refers to the **sum of all item quantities** in the order, not
  the number of distinct products.
</Note>

> **Example for “is multiple of”**:  
> `is multiple of 5` → Matches orders with total quantities like 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.
