### Product tag

This condition checks the **product tag** in the order against specific criteria. It will become true if **any** product in the cart has the entered Product Tag value, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **has value of** (Matches when the product tag has the specified value)
- **does not have value of** (Matches when the product tag does not have the specified value)
- **has any other value besides** (Matches when the product tag has any value except the entered one)
- **does not have any other value besides** (Matches when the product tag has only the entered value and no other)

To set these conditions, enter the value in the “Enter value” field, then choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.

> For example, `has value of NewArrival` → Matches when the product tag is **NewArrival**.
