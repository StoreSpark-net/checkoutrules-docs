### Collection

This condition checks the **collection** in the order against specific criteria. It will become true if **any** of the product in the cart belongs to the entered Collection value, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **has value of** (Matches when the collection has the specified value)
- **does not have value of** (Matches when the collection does not have the specified value)
- **has any other value besides** (Matches when the collection has any value except the entered one)
- **does not have any other value besides** (Matches when the collection has only the entered value and no other)

To set these conditions, click on the “Enter value” field to open the collection selection popup, then search for or directly select the desired collection, and choose the appropriate comparison from the dropdown.
