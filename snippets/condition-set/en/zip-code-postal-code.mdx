### Zip code / Postal code

Used to compare the Zip code / Postal code (The Zip/Postal Code field on the checkout page in shipping address) values with one or more specific zip or postal codes, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Has any of these values** (Matches if the zip/postal code field contains at least one of the listed values)
- **Does not have any of these values** (Matches if the zip/postal code field does not contain any of the listed values)
- **Has value in between these values** (Matches if the zip/postal code field value falls within the specified range)
- **Does not have value in between these values** (Matches if the zip/postal code field value does not fall within the specified range)
- **Has any other value besides these values** (Matches if the zip/postal code field contains values other than the listed ones)
- **Does not have any other value besides these values** (Matches if the zip/postal code field contains only the listed values and no others)
- **Has only digits** (Matches if the zip/postal code field contains only numeric characters)
- **Does not have only digits** (Matches if the zip/postal code field contains any non-numeric characters)
- **Has number of digits in between** (Matches if the number of digits falls within the specified range)
- **Does not have number of digits in between** (Matches if the number of digits does not fall within the specified range)
- **Is empty** (Matches if the zip/postal code field has no value)
- **Is not empty** (Matches if the zip/postal code field contains any value)

Use **Has any of these values**, **Does not have any of these values**, **Has any other value besides these values**, or **Does not have any other value besides these values** to match against one or more specific zip/postal codes. Separate multiple values with commas.

<Note>
  Use * wildcard to match multiple zip codes. For example, BT* will match BT12,
  bt-590 etc. Use ? to match to any single character.
</Note>

> For example, `Has any of these values: BT*` → Matches all zip/postal codes starting with “BT”.

> Another example, `Does not have any of these values: 12345, 67890` → Matches if the code is not “12345” or “67890”.

Use **Has value in between these values** or **Does not have value in between these values** to match zip/postal codes within or outside a numeric range.

<Note>
  Enter numbers only. All values ranging in between starting value until the
  last value will be matched, including the starting and last value.
</Note>

> For example, `Has value in between these values: 10000 – 20000` → Matches if the code is between “10000” and “20000”.

Use **Has only digits** or **Does not have only digits** to match zip/postal codes that contain only numeric characters (0–9) or those that include any non-numeric characters, such as letters, spaces, or symbols.

> For example, `Has only digits` → Matches digits only (0–9).

Use **Has number of digits in between** or **Does not have number of digits in between** to match based on the count of digits in the code.

<Note>
  Enter numbers only. All values ranging in between given number of digits will
  be matched.
</Note>

> For example, `Has number of digits in between: 4 – 6` → Matches codes that contain between 4 and 6 digits.

Use **Is empty** or **Is not empty** when you only need to check whether the field is filled in.

> For example, `Is not empty` → Matches if any value is entered in the field
