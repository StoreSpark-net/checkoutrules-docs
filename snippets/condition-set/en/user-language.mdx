### User language

This condition checks the language selected by the customer, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Has any of these values** (Matches if the customer language is from the given list)
- **Does not have any of these values** (Matches if the customer language is not from the given list)
- **Has any other value besides these values** (Matches if the customer language is not from the given list)
- **Does not have any other value besides these values** (Matches if the customer language is from the given list and no others)

For any of the above options, search and select one or more languages from the list. You can also use the **Paste**, **Copy all**, or **Clear all** options for quick selection.

> For example, `Does not have any of these values: English, French` → Matches if the field does not contain “English” or “French”.
