### Full name (First name + Last name)

Used to compare the customer’s full name with one or more specific values, counts, or states, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **Contains** (Matches if the full name contains the specified value or partial value)
- **Does not contain** (Matches if the full name does not contain the specified value or partial value)
- **Is empty** (Matches if no name is entered)
- **Is not empty** (Matches if any value is entered in the name field)
- **Is** (Matches if the full name exactly matches the specified value)
- **Is not** (Matches if the full name is not exactly the specified value)
- **Has no of characters greater than or equals** (Matches if the total character count in the name is greater than or equal to the specified number)
- **Has no of characters less than or equals** (Matches if the total character count in the name is less than or equal to the specified number)
- **Has only** (Matches if the full name contains only the allowed character type from the dropdown)
- **Does not have only** (Matches if the full name contains characters other than the allowed character type from the dropdown)

For **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is**, and **Is not**, enter the value to match.

> For example, `Does not contain: Test` → Matches if the name does not contain “Test” anywhere.

  > For example, `has only: english characters` → Matches if the customer’s name contains english characters only.
