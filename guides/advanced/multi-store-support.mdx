## Overview

You can copy over rules between different Shopify stores without having to create them manually. You can export rules from one store as a ZIP file and then import that file into another store. This saves time, ensures consistency, and makes it easier to manage similar rules across multiple stores. You can also create a backup of your rules in case you need to restore them later.

## Usage

### Export rules

Select one or more rules in your current store and export them. The selected rules can be downloaded as a **ZIP file** to your computer or exported as individual files.

Here are the steps to export rules:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select rules">

You can select one or multiple rules that you want to export. Then, click on the three dots and select **"Export"**. Then a popup will appear.

Alternatively, you can export a single rule by opening the rule, clicking **"More actions"**, and then selecting **"Export"** to export that rule individually.

/>
</Step>


<Step title="Choose export format">

In the popup, choose one of the following options:

- **ZIP archive** (Downloads a single ZIP file containing all the selected rules)
- **Individual files** (Downloads each selected rule as a separate JSON file with staggered timing)

</Step>

<Step title="Complete export">

Lastly, click "Export" to export the rules.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Import rules

Open another Shopify store, go to the import option, and upload the previously exported **ZIP file** or individual rule JSON files. All the rules inside the ZIP or the selected JSON files will be added to the new store.

Here are the steps to import rules:

<Steps>
<Step title="Click Import button">

Click the **"Import"** button. Then a popup will appear.

  alt="Click Import button"
/>
</Step>

<Step title="Add files or drop files to upload">

In the popup, add your files or drag and drop them (for example, `Rename payment methods-besure-export.json`).

</Step>

<Step title="Complete import">

Lastly, click the **"Import"** button in the popup to import the rules into the store.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Example use case

Let’s say you manage two Shopify stores:

- **Store A** → already has discount rules for different customer groups.
- **Store B** → needs the same discount rules.

Instead of recreating the rules from scratch in **Store B**, you can:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export rules from Store A">
    Export the rules from <strong>Store A</strong> as a ZIP file.
    <img
      src="/images/advanced/multi-store-support/export-rules.webp"
      alt="Export From Store A"
    />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import rules into Store B">
    Import that ZIP file into <strong>Store B</strong>.
    <img
      src="/images/advanced/multi-store-support/import-into-store-b.webp"
      alt="Import Into Store B"
    />
  </Step>
</Steps>

The rules will be imported and ready for use immediately.
