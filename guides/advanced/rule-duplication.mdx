## Overview

Rule Duplication allows you to quickly create a new rule based on an existing one.  
Instead of building a rule from scratch, you can duplicate it, make a few changes, and set it up in less time.  

This is especially useful when the new rule you want to create is very similar to an existing one.

## Usage
### Select rules  
You can select one or multiple rules that you want to duplicate.  

<img

  alt="Select Rules"
/>

### Duplicate action 
Click on the three dots, then click on "Duplicate". A confirmation popup will appear.

  alt="Duplicate action"
/>

Then, in the popup, click "Duplicate" to create copies of the selected rules.

### Modify rules  
Update the duplicated rules by changing only the parts you need to adjust, such as conditions or values.  

> For example, if the original rule gives a **10% discount** on orders over **100 dollars**, you can duplicate it and modify the condition to apply the discount on orders over **150 dollars**.

### Save rules  
Once modified, save the new rules without affecting the original ones.  

<img
  src="/images/advanced/rule-duplication/save-rules.webp"
  alt="Save Rules"
/>

## Example use case  
Letâ€™s say you already have a rule that applies a discount to customers in the **United States**. If you want to create the same rule for customers in **Canada**, you can do it in two simple steps:

- Create a copy of the existing **United States discount rule**. 

<img

  alt="Duplicate United States Rule"
/>

- Update the location setting to **Canada** and save the new rule.
