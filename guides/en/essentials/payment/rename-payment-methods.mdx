## Rule overview

This rule allows you to rename, translate, or add a message to specific payment methods at the checkout based on defined conditions. You can customize the displayed payment method labels using criteria such as cart value, shipping address, customer tags, or product details, etc.

This helps enhance clarity, support localization, and improve the overall checkout experience for customers.

## Sample configuration

The following steps show how to create and configure a **Rename Payment Methods** rule using the app.

### Create a new rule

From your [Shopify admin](/guides/en/get-started/installation#go-to-the-app), open the app. In the sidebar, go to the [Rules](/guides/en/get-started/quickstart#create-a-sample-rule) section and click _"Create Rule"_.

Then, You’ll be redirected to the **Select checkout rule type screen**. Choose _category "Payment" → select checkout rule type "Rename Payment Methods" → click “Select Rule”_.

Next, you’ll land on the **Create new rename payment methods rule** screen, where you can configure your rule.

### Rule configuration

To configure the rule, first optionally we can add a name such as "Rename payment methods" to describe what it does. Then, select the rule [status](/guides/en/get-started/concepts#status): Testing, Active, or Deactivated.

Here we are going to choose **Testing** status, so we can quickly test the rule without affecting the checkout for actual customers.

Next, on the same screen, select the relevant [condition set](/guides/en/get-started/concepts#condition-set), [condition](/guides/en/get-started/concepts#conditions-when), and [action](/guides/en/get-started/concepts#action-what).

> As an example, We are using **Condition set 1**, setting the rule to run **Always**, and configuring it to rename the payment method **"Cash on Delivery (COD)"** to **"Pay Cash"**.

Alternatively, we can set the “Rename to” option to “Add message” to append a custom message to the payment method name instead of fully renaming it.

Finally, click the <b>Save</b> button at the top to create and save your rule.

## Test the rule

Since, the rule is set to testing status, we have to use `test@testing.com` as the email, instead of the actual email, to run the rule at checkout.

<Warning>
  The image below shows the checkout page <b>before</b> the testing email
  address was used. Please note the Cash on Delivery (COD) payment method is not
  yet renamed.
</Warning>

/>

After setting the email, the checkout rule runs and renames the specified payment methods. We can verify that the **"Cash on Delivery (COD)"** payment method is now displayed as **"Pay Cash"**, as shown below.

## Activate the rule

Once testing is done, we can activate the rule, so it can start making changes to the checkout for actual customers. Only activated rules can make changes to the checkout for all customers.

Click on **Rules** in the sidebar to view all rules. Select the rule you want to activate, then click the **Activate** button to activate it.

<Warning>
  Rule activation is only available on paid plans. If you haven't upgraded your
  plan yet, follow the instructions
  [here](/guides/en/get-started/installation#upgrade-your-plan) to upgrade.
