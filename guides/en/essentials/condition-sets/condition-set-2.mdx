### P.O. box address

The selected condition is based on whether the customer's address includes a P.O. Box. This condition can be used to trigger specific actions, such as restricting certain shipping methods or applying special handling rules for orders going to P.O. Box addresses.

<Note>
  When you use the 'P.O. box address' condition in the rule, then all kind of
  entries in the shipping address like P.O. box or P O box or P.o b o x etc are
  detected by the app automatically. If you want to also detect a custom word or
  phrase, you can do that by using the 'Address line' condition within which you
  can specify the word or phrase you want to detect.
</Note>

<Info>
  If you want to detect PO Box words or phrase in other languages, you can do
  that by using the 'Address (line1 + line2)' condition within which you can
  specify the words or phrase you want to detect. For example, 'Packstation' in
  German. You can add mulitple of these conditions for each word using the OR
  operator in between them.

## Comparisons

### Product quantity per SKU vs Product quantity per SKU

This condition compares the **product quantity of one SKU** with the **product quantity of another SKU**, based on one of the following sub-conditions:

- **has quantity which is equal to** (Matches if the quantity of SKU1 is exactly equal to the quantity of SKU2)
- **has quantity which is not equal to** (Matches if the quantity of SKU1 is different from the quantity of SKU2)
- **has quantity which is greater than or equals to** (Matches if the quantity of SKU1 is greater than or equal to the quantity of SKU2)
- **has quantity which is less than or equals to** (Matches if the quantity of SKU1 is less than or equal to the quantity of SKU2)
- **has quantity which is multiple of** (Matches if the quantity of SKU1 is an exact multiple of the quantity of SKU2)
- **has quantity which is not multiple of** (Matches if the quantity of SKU1 is not an exact multiple of the quantity of SKU2)

To set these conditions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter SKU for first product">
    Enter the <strong>SKU code</strong> for the first product in the <strong>Enter SKU1</strong> field.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter SKU for second product">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose comparison option">

</Steps>

> **Example for “has quantity which is greater than or equals to”**:  
> SKU1: `SKU-ABC`  
> SKU2: `SKU-XYZ`  
> → Matches when the quantity of `SKU-ABC` in the cart is greater than or equal to the quantity of `SKU-XYZ`.
